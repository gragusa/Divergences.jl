# Divergences.jl

`Divergences.jl` is a Julia package that makes it easy to evaluate divergence measures between two vectors. The package allows calculating the *gradient*  and the diagonal of the *Hessian* of several divergences. These divergences are used to good effect by the  [MomentBasedEstimators](http://github.com/gragusa/MomentBasedEstimators.jl/git) package.


## Supported divergences

The package defines an abstract `Divergence` type with the following suptypes:

* Kullback-Leibler divergence `KullbackLeibler`
* Chi-square distance `ChiSquared`
* Reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence `ReverseKullbackLeibler`
* Cressie-Read divergences `CressieRead`

These divergences differ from the equivalent ones defined in the `Distances` package because they are normalized. Also, the package provides methods for calculating their gradient and the (diagonal elements of the) Hessian matrix.

The constructors for the types above are straightforward
```julia
KullbackLeibler()
ChiSqaured()
ReverseKullbackLeibler()
```
The `CressieRead` type define a family of divergences indexed by a parameter `alpha`. The constructor for `CressieRead` is
```julia
CR(::Real)
```
The Hellinger divergence is obtained by `CR(-1/2)`. For a certain value of `alpha`, `CressieRead` correspond to a divergence that has a specific type defined. For instance `CR(1)` is equivalent to `ChiSquared` although the underlying code for evaluation and calculation of the gradient and Hessian are different. 

Three versions of each divergence in the above list are implemented currently. A *vanilla* version, a modified version, and a fully modified version. These modifications extend the domain of the divergence.

The **modified** version takes an additional argument that specifies the point at which the divergence is modified by a convex extension. 
```julia
ModifiedKullbackLeibler(theta::Real)
ModifiedReverseKullbackLeibler(theta::Real)
ModifiedCressieRead(alpha::Real, theta::Real)
```

Similarly, the **fully modified** version takes **two** additional arguments that specify the points at which the divergence is modified by a convex extensions.
```julia
FullyModifiedKullbackLeibler(phi::Real, theta::Real)
FullyModifiedReverseKullbackLeibler(phi::Real, theta::Real)
FullyModifiedCressieRead(alpha::Real, phi::Real, theta::Real)
```


## Basic usage 

### Divergence between two vectors

Each divergence corresponds to a *divergence type*. You can always compute a certain divergence between two vectors using the following syntax

```julia
d = evaluate(div, x, y)
```

Here, `div` is an instance of a divergence type. For example, the type for Kullback Leibler divergence is ``KullbackLeibler`` (more divergence types are described in some details in what follows), then the Kullback Leibler divergence between ``x`` and ``y`` can be computed
```julia
d = evaluate(KullbackLeibler(), x, y)
```

We can also calculate the diverge between the vector ``x`` and the unit vector
```julia
r = evaluate(KullbackLeibler(), x)
```

The `Divergence` type is a subtype of `PreMetric` defined in the `Distances` package. As such, the divergences can be evaluated row-wise and column-wise for `X::Matrix` and `Y::Matrix`. 

```julia
rowise(div, X, Y)
```

```julia
colwise(div, X, Y)
```

### Gradient of the divergence

To calculate the gradient of  `div::Divergence` with respect to ``x::AbstractArray{Float64, 1}`` the
`gradient` method can be used
```julia
g = gradient(div, x, y)
```
or through its in-place version
```julia
gradient!(Array(Float64, size(x)), div, x, y)
```

### Hessian of the divergence
The `hessian` method calculate the Hessian of the divergence with respect to ``x`` 
```julia
h = hessian(div, x, y)
```
Its in-place variant is also defined
```julia
hessian!(Array(Float64, size(x)), div, x, y)
```

Notice that the Hessian of a divergence is sparse, where the diagonal entries are the only ones different from zero. For this reason, `hessian(div, x, y)` return an `Array{Float64,1}` with the diagonal entries of the hessian.
